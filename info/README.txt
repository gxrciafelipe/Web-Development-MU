Milestone 1
For this Project, I've created two websites: index.html and contact.html;
On index, I've put some basic information about me, the purpose of the website and also a picture of me. Also, there's a navigation bar where the user can easily switch between both websites.
On contact, I've put my contact information and I also implemented a simple form where the user can contact me by including their name, email, and message.
I've put a list on my the index page, listing my interests; I've put a table on the contact page, to show my social media organized; And I've put the special character &copy; at the footer of both pages to indicate a copyright.

Milestone 2
For this next step, I've styled both the home and the contact pages. I've implemented an external CSS stylesheet using many configurations that I've learned so far to make the webpages look more pleasant both for me and for whoever may see them.
I used Arial as my first font option, followed by Helvetica, and then a third sans-serif font. Also, I decided to use the rgb color #333333 for the body font color. For hover actions, I've used light blue and Orange. And, fot the background colors, I've used shades of gray. I want to implement a light/dark toggle switch on my page later, and improve some actions with JavaScript.
